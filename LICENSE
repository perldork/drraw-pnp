This work is a derived work based on the work of Christophe Kalt.  Original
license is below; this derived work conforms to the original BSD-style
license Christophe used to originally develop it and full credits to
him exist in the work to make it clear that this project is a 
derivation of his original code.

Special thanks to my managers Mike Fischer and Jason Livingood at
Comcast for allowing me to re-contribute my variation of Christophe's 
work back to the OSS community.
