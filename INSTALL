-- drraw NEWS

Version 2.3 adds support for PNP XML descriptor to RRD file mappings to make
it easy to integrate drraw with PNP - MES.

Version 2.2 adds full support for the new features found in RRDtool 1.2 and
above.  It is important to note that RRDtool 1.2 and above deprecate a number
of graph commands previously available.  drraw handles this in the following
way:

* deprecated syntax is not allowed when creating new graphs.
* deprecated syntax from old saved graphs is converted (when possible) when
  drawing these graphs.
* deprecated syntax from old saved graphs is never converted when editing
  these graphs, this has to be done manually.

-- drraw dependencies

drraw requires:

* a working perl with the CGI module.  It was originally written and tested
  using version 5.6.1.  It is known to run fine on UNIX (with Apache) as
  well as Windows (with Apache and IIS).
  Note that on Windows, ActivePerl 5.8.0 is required but that earlier versions
  may work as long as you comment out lines with calls to alarm().
* The RRDtool Perl module "RRDs" is also (unsurprisingly) needed.
  It is strongly recommended to use version 1.0.47 or above if possible,
  and version 1.0.36 at the very least.

-- drraw installation notes

drraw is a standalone CGI script with a separate configuration file.
The file drraw.cgi should be installed as a CGI script for your web server,
and the drraw.conf file should be copied to the same directory.

There is a sample Apache configuration snippet in the misc/ directory for
drraw-pnp.

******************************************************************************
** To get going, the only configuration required is %datadirs in drraw.conf **
******************************************************************************

While all the configurable options are located in the drraw.conf file, you
will need to edit drraw.cgi if
(a) you want to put the drraw.conf file somewhere else,
(b) the RRDs.pm perl module was not installed in a directory mentioned
    in your perl's @INC,
(c) UNIX: /usr/bin/perl doesn't exist or isn't the perl you want to use
    OTHERS: Typically, web servers running on non UNIX platforms will ignore
            the first line of the script and are instead configured to use
            Perl (for example).  Microsoft IIS is an example of such a server.
            To get drraw working on such a server you have three choices:
            (1) Remove the -T option on the first line.  !!!NOT RECOMMENDED!!!
            (2) Configure the server to run Perl scripts with taint mode on.
                (This will affect _all_ Perl scripts.)
            (3) Work around the problem by creating a second special extension
                such as tcgi or tgi which is associated with taint mode Perl.

-- drraw security

Don't believe that because drraw is open source, it is secure.  This is just
stupid anti Microsoft propaganda.  To my knowledge, noone has ever thoroughly
reviewed drraw's code, meaning that while some care was taken to write a safe
tool, it comes with NO GUARANTEE at all.  Run it at your own risk.

This said, drraw uses Perl's "taint mode", and has a simple (and optional)
security system built-in to allow restricting read-write access.  In other
words, you should be fine (but don't take my word on it).
